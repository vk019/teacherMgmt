              The Origin of the Idea
              </h1>
              <p className="lead  text-center fs-4 mb-5">
              Every year through the government exams plenty of teachers are hired and posted in various government schools.
              The tracking of teachers from recruitment to their entire service duration is done manually which makes it difficult to manage and keep track.
<br/>

              The platform would be helpful in keeping track of all the government teachers after their CTET test. 
              It would streamline the process of recruitment which is a very time-consuming, repetitive, and mundane task, 
              which also includes a huge amount of manual errors and the time required to understand and resolve those errors. 
              So, to eliminate unnecessary time waste and to make the process of keeping track of teachers' performance efficient and easy, 
              we propose an idea of a common portal for gov. authorities, teachers, schools to provide a centralized digital platform, 
              where all the three entities can communicate easily and effectively. 
              In this way, the digitalization of the process can be implemented, 
              which will free teachers and administrators from their burdensome work 
              and allow them to spend more time focusing on their key goals.
